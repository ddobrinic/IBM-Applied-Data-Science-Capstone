# Introduction
SpaceX stands as a revolutionary force in the space industry, disrupting traditional norms by offering rocket launches, particularly Falcon 9, at an unprecedented cost of as low as 62 million dollars, a significant reduction compared to other providers charging upwards of 165 million dollars per launch. This substantial cost-saving innovation is primarily attributed to SpaceX's groundbreaking concept of reusing the first stage of the rocket by successfully re-landing it for deployment in subsequent missions. The iterative application of this process promises further reductions in launch costs.
As a data scientist for a startup aiming to compete with SpaceX, the primary objective of this project is to establish a robust machine learning pipeline capable of predicting the landing outcome of Falcon 9's first stage in future missions. The success of this predictive model is pivotal in determining the optimal bidding price against SpaceX for rocket launches.

Key challenges addressed in this project include:
* Identifying all relevant factors influencing the landing outcome.
* Investigating the relationships between each variable and their impact on the overall outcome.
* Determining the optimal conditions necessary to enhance the probability of a successful landing
